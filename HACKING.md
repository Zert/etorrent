# Introduction

This document describes an architectural overview of the Etorrent
application. It is meant for hackers to be used for doing changes on
the application and bootstrap them to be able to do changes faster.

The document is currently dated:

    2010-12-22

And information herein might need a review if we are much after this
date because the code is in constant motion. This is a warning. Ask
for an update if it is too old!

# General layout of the source code

This is the hierarchy:

    /apps/ - Container for the etorrent application
    /apps/etorrent/ - The etorrent application
    /apps/etorrent/doc/ - edoc-generated output for the etorrent app.
    /apps/etorrent/ebin/ - Where .beam files are compiled to
    /apps/etorrent/include/ - include (.hrl) files
    /apps/etorrent/priv/ - private data for the app.
    /apps/etorrent/src/ - main source code

The above should not pose any trouble with a seasoned or beginning
erlang hacker.

    /apps/etorrent/priv/webui/htdocs/

This directory contains the data used by the Web UI system. It is
basically dumping ground for Javascript code and anything static we
want to present to a user of the applications web interface.

    /deps/ - dependencies are downloaded to here
    /dev/ - when you generate development embedded VMs they go here
    /documentation/ - haphazard general documentation about etorrent
    /tools/ - small tools for manipulating and developing the source
    /rel/ - stuff for making releases

The release stuff follow the general conventions laid bare by *rebar*
so I wont be covering it here.

# Building a development environment

This is documented in README.md, so follow the path from there.

# Code walk-through.

This is the meaty part. I hope it will help a hacker to easily see
what is happening in the application.

There is a supervisor-structure documented by the date in the
*/documentation*. You may wish to peruse it.

## Top level structure.

The two important program entry points are:

    etorrent_app.erl
    etorrent_sup.erl

The `etorrent_app' defines what is needed to make etorrent an
application. When we make a release through the release system, we
arrange that this application will be started automatically. So that
is what makes etorrent start up. The important function is `start/2'
which does some simple configuration and then launches the main
supervisor, `etorrent_sup'.

The main etorrent supervisor starts up *lots of stuff*. In general the
things started fall into three categories:

  * Global book keepers. These processes keep track of global state
    and are not expected to die. They are usually fairly simple
    processes which does very few things by themselves.

  * Global processes. Any process in etorrent is either *global*,
    *torrent local* or *peer local* depending on whether it is used by
    all torrents, by a single torrent or by a single peer
    respectively. This split is what gives us fault tolerance. If a
    torrent dies, isolation gives us that only that particular torrent
    will.

  * Supervisors. There are several. The most important is the one
    maintaining a pool of torrents. Other maintain sub-parts of the
    protocol which are not relevant to the initial understanding.

An important supervisor maintains the Directory Watcher. This process,
the `etorrent_dirwatcher' is a gen_server which is the starting entry
point for the life cycle of a torrent. It periodically watches the
directory and when a torrent is added, it will execute
`etorrent_ctl:start/1' to actually start the torrent.

The `etorrent_ctl' gen_server is an interface to start and stop
torrents for real. Starting a torrent is very simple. We start up a
torrent supervisor and add it to the pool of currently alive
torrents. Nothing more happens at the top level -- the remaining work
is by the torrent supervisor, found in `etorrent_torrent_sup'.

### The etorrent module

The module `etorrent' is an interface to etorrent via the erl
shell. Ask it to give help by running `etorrent:help()'.

## Dependencies

Etorrent currently use two dependencies:

### Gproc

GProc is a process table written by Ulf Wiger at Erlang Solutions. It
basically maintains a lookup table in ETS for processes. We use this
throughout etorrent whenever we want to get hold of a process which is
not "close" in the supervisor tree. We do this because it is way
easier than to propagate around process ids all the time. GProc has a
distributed component which we are not using at all.

### riak_err

The built-in SASL error logger of Erlang has problems when the
messages it tries to log goes beyond a certain size. It manifests
itself by the beam process taking up several gigabytes of memory. The
`riak_err' application built by Basho technologies remedies this
problem. It is configured with a maximal size and will gracefully
limit the output so these kinds of errors does not occur.

The downside is less configurability. Most notably, etorrent is quite
spammy in its main console. One way around it is to connect to
etorrent via another node,

    erl -name 'foo@127.0.0.1' \
        -remsh 'etorrent@127.0.0.1' \
	-setcookie etorrent

and then carry out commands from there.

## Torrent supervisors

The torrent supervisor is `etorrent_torrent_sup'. This one will
initially spawn supervisors to handle a pool of filesystem processes
and a pool of peers. And finally, it will spawn a controller process,
which will control the torrent in question.

Initially, the control process will wait in line until it is its turn
to perform a *check* of the torrent for correctness. To make the check
fast, there is a global process, the `fast_resume' process which
persists the check data to disk every 5 minute. If the fast-resume
data is consistent this is used. Otherwise, the control-process will
check the torrent for pieces missing and pieces which we have and
ok. It will then spawn a process in the supervisor, by adding a child,
the `tracker_communication' process.

Tracker communication will contact the tracker and get a list of
peers. It will report to the tracker that we exist, that we started
downloading the torrent, how many bytes we have
downloaded/uploaded and how many bytes there are left to download. The
tracker process lives throughout the life-cycle of a torrent. It
periodically contacts the tracker and it will also make a last contact
to the tracker when the torrent is *stopped*. This final contact is
ensured since the tracker-communicator server traps exits.

The peers are then sent to a *global* process, the `peer_mgr', which
manages peers. Usually the peers will be started by adding them back
into the peer pool of the right process right away, but if we have too
many connections to peers, they will enter a queue. Also, peers will
be filtered, if we are already connected to them.

**Incoming peer connections** We cover these here: To handle these, we
have a global supervisor maintaining a small pool of accepting
processes. When a peer connects to us, we perform part of the
handshake in the acceptor-process. We confer with several other parts
of the system. As soon as the remote peer transfers the InfoHash, we
look it up locally to see if this is a torrent we are currently
working on. If not, we kill the connection. If it is alive, we check
to see if too many peers are connected, otherwise we allow it, blindly
(there is an opportunity for an optimization here).

## Peers

A peer is governed by a supervisor as well, the
`etorrent_peer_sup'. It will control three gen_servers: One for
sending messages to the remote peer and keeping a queue of outgoing
messages. One for receiving and decoding incoming messages. And
finally one for controlling the communication and running the peer
wire protocol we use to communicate with peers.

The supervisor is configured to die at the *instant* one of the other
processes die. And the peer pool supervisor parent assumes everything
are temporary. This means that an error in a peer will kill all
processes and it will remove the peer permanently. There is a
*monitor* set by the `peer_mgr' on the peer, so it may try to connect
in more peers when it registers death of a peer. In turn, this
behaviour ensures progress.

Peers are rather autonomous to the rest of the system. But they are
collaborating with several torrent-local and global processes. In the
following, we will try to explain what they do and how they work.

## File system

The file system code, hanging on `etorrent_torrent_sup' as a
supervision tree maintains the storage of the file on-disk. Peers
communicate with these processes to read out pieces and store
pieces. The FS processes is split so there is a process per file. And
that file-process governs reading and writing. There is also a
directory-process which knows about how to write and read a piece by
its offsets and lengths into files. For multifile-torrents a single
piece read may span several files and this directory makes it possible
to know whom to ask.

## Chunk/Piece Management

There are two, currently global, processes called the
`etorrent_piece_mgr' and `etorrent_chunk_mgr'. The first of these, the
Piece Manager, keeps track of pieces for torrents we are
downloading. In particular it maps what pieces we have downloaded and
what pieces we are missing. It is used by peer processes so they can
tell remote peers what pieces we have.

The BitTorrent protocol does not exchange pieces. It exchanges
*slices* of pieces. These are in etorrent terminology called *chunks*
although other clients use *sub-pieces* for the same thing. Hence, the
Chunk Manager keeps track of chunks of pieces. When a piece is chosen,
it is "chunked" into smaller 16 Kilobyte chunks. These are then
requested from peers. Note that we prefer to get all chunks of a piece
downloaded as fast as possible so we may mark the piece as done and
then exchange it with other peers. Hence the algorithm to select
chunks prefers already chunked up pieces.

Another important part of the chunk manager is to ensure exclusive
access to a chunk. There is little reason to download the same chunk
from multiple peers. Thus, we earmark chunks to peers. If the peer
dies, a monitor ensures we get the pieces back into consideration for
other peers. Finally, there is a special *endgame* mode which is
triggered when we are close to having the complete file. In this mode,
we ignore the exclusivity rule and spam requests to all connected
peers. The current rule is that when there are no more pieces to chunk
up and we can't get exclusive pieces, we "steal" from other peers. A
random shuffle of remaining pieces tries to eliminate too many multiples.

**Note:** This part of the code is under rework at the moment. In
particular we seek to make the processes torrent-local rather than
global and maintain the piece maps and chunk maps differently. Talk to
Magnus Klaar for the details.

## Choking

A central point to the BitTorrent protocol is that you keep, say, 200
connections to peers, but you only communicate on a few of them, some
10-20. This avoids congestion problems in TCP/IP. The process of
choosing who to communicate with is called choking/unchoking. There is
a global server process, the `etorrent_choker', responsible for
selecting the peers to communicate with. It wakes up every 10 seconds
and then selects, re-chokes, peers.

The rules are quite intricate and it is advised to study them in
detail. To make the decision several parameters are taken into
account:

   * The rate of the peer, either in send or receive direction.
   * Is the peer choking us?
   * Is the peer interested in pieces we have?
   * Are we interested in pieces the peer has?

Furthermore, we have a circular ring of peers used for optimistic
un-choking. The ring is moved forward a notch every 30 seconds and
ensures that *all* peers eventually get a chance. If a peer is better
than those we already download from, we will by this mechanism
eventually latch onto it.

# So you want to hack etorrent? Cool!

I am generally liberal, but there is one thing you should not do:

Patch Bombs.

A patch bomb is when a developer sits in his own corner for 4-5 months
and suddenly comes by with a patch of gargantuan size, say several
thousand lines of code changes. I won't accept such a patch - ever.

If you have a cool plan, I encourage you to mail me:
jesper.louis.andersen@gmail.com so we can set up a proper mailing list
and document our design discussions in the list archives. That way, we
may be able to break the problem into smaller pieces and we may get a
better solution by discussing it beforehand.

If you have a bug-fix or smaller patch it is ok to just come with it,
preferably on google code as a regular patch(1) or a git-patch. If you
know it is going to take you a considerable amount of time fixing the
problem, submit an issue first and then hack away. That way, others
may be able to chime in and comment on the problem.

*Remember to add yourself to the AUTHORS list.*

## "I just want to hack, what is there to do?"

Check the Issue tracker for enhancement requests and bugs. Ask me. I
might have something you would like to do. The TODO list are "Things
we certainly need to do!" and the issue tracker is used for "Things we
may do."  Note that people can vote up stuff on the issue tracker.
